# Kurator

## Overview

Kurator is an open source distributed cloud native platform that helps users to build their own distributed cloud native infrastructure and facilitates enterprise digital transformation.

Kurator stands on shoulders of many popular cloud native software stacks including
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio), [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), [FluxCD](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [KubeEdge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge), [Volcano](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano), [Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada), [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno), etc.
It provides powerful capabilities for multi-cloud and multi-cluster management, including:

- Multi-cloud, Edge-cloud, Edge-edge Synergy
- Unified Resource Orchestration
- Unified Scheduling
- Unified Traffic Management
- Unified Telemetry

## Advantages

- Infrastructure-as-Code: declarative way of infrastructure(cluster, node, vpc, etc) management on cloud, edge or on premises.
- Out of box: one button to install cloud native software stacks
- Unified management of clusters with fleet:

1. Support cluster registration and un-registration to a fleet.
1. Application customize and sync across fleet.
1. Namespaces, ServiceAccount, Service sameness across clusters of a fleet.
1. Provide service discovery and communication across clusters.
