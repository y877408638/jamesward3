    The easiest way to deploy cluster on VMs with Kurator.
---

You can easily manage the VMs cluster with Kurator, including the installation, deletion, upgrade and scale of the VMs cluster.

These properties are built on [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io) and [KubeSpray](https://kubespray.io/).

This guide will describe how to create and delete the k8s cluster on VMs with Kurator.

## Prerequisites

### Install Kurator and cluster operator

Follow the guide [Build cluster-operator](https://github.com/kurator-dev/kurator/tree/main/cmd/cluster-operator) to build cluster-operator from source.

You can check the cluster-operator with follow command.

```console
# get the cluster operator
$ kubectl get pod -A | grep kurator-cluster-operator
kurator-system       kurator-cluster-operator-857cf45445-lkwsw               1/1     Running             0          17s
```

### Installs an SSH key for your VMs

Assuming the public IP address of the VMs where you want to install K8s is "200.x.x.1" and "200.x.x.2".
The private IP address is "192.x.x.1" and "192.x.x.2".

#### Generate a public and private key pair

You can generate a public and private key pair as follows.

```console
ssh-keygen
```

You need follow prompts to "Enter file in which to save the key" and "Enter passphrase".

#### Installs an authorized key

```console
ssh-copy-id 200.x.x.1 
ssh-copy-id 200.x.x.2
```

#### Check your access

Then you can get access without requiring a password for each login.

```console
ssh 200.x.x.1 
ssh 200.x.x.2
```

### Create the secret for operator

Now you can easily log in VMs, but you still need to pass this ability to Kurator operator through secret.

#### Create the secret with kubectl

```console
kubectl create secret generic cluster-secret --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
```

"secret/cluster-secret created" will appear.

#### Check the secret

You can check your secret with follow command.

```console
$ kubectl describe secrets cluster-secret
Name:         cluster-secret
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
ssh-privatekey:  2590 bytes
ssh-publickey:   565 bytes
```

### Configure your resources

You can find resources examples from the path "manifests/examples/customcluster/" in Kurator Repository.

Here are the four types of resources needed for VMs cluster managementï¼š

- cluster
- kcp(KubeadmControlPlane)
- customCluster
- customMachine

You can copy the examples and replaces the parameters to what you need:

```console
cp -rfp manifests/examples/customcluster manifests/examples/my-customcluster
```

You need to edit the hosts configuration of the VMs first.

```console
$ vi manifests/examples/my-customcluster/cc-custommachine.yaml
apiVersion: cluster.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: CustomMachine
metadata:
  name: cc-custommachine
  namespace: default
spec:
  master:
    - hostName: master1
      # edit to your real parameters
      publicIP: 200.x.x.1 
      # edit to your real parameters
      privateIP: 192.x.x.1 
      instanceType: node
      sshKey:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        name: cluster-secret
  node:
    - hostName: node1
      # edit to your real parameters
      publicIP: 200.x.x.2
      # edit to your real parameters
      privateIP: 192.x.x.2
      sshKey:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        name: cluster-secret
```

If you just modify the IP and run the example resource directly, you will get a cluster with a master and a worker.

Here are some optional parameters you may care about and the setting position:

| parameters | setting-position |
| :-----| :---- | 
| KubeVersion | kcp-version | 
| PodCIDR | cluster-clusterNetwork-pods-cidrBlocks | 
| CNIPlugin | customCluster-CNI-type | 

## Create a k8s cluster for VMs

Now everything ready and let's start to create a k8s cluster for your VMs.

### Apply resource configuration

```console
kubectl apply -f manifests/examples/my-customcluster
```

### Check your Installation

If you want more operator log details, you can use following command.

```console
# replace the "kurator-cluster-operator-857cf45445-lkwsw" to your own operator name
kubectl logs -n kurator-system kurator-cluster-operator-857cf45445-lkwsw
```

Check the pod of installing cluster.

```console
$ kubectl get pod | grep cc-customcluster-init
cc-customcluster-init   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          15s
```

The status of "ContainerCreating" may take 40 minute for image pulling and the status of "Running" may take 15 min.

Image pulling only needs to be executed once on the same kind cluster.

If you want see the procedures of init worker, you can use following command.

```console
kubectl logs cc-customcluster-init
```

### Confirm your Installation

When the installation of cluster is done, the status of the init worker will change from "running" to "complete". The phase of customCluster will also change into "succeeded".

You can turn to the terminal of VMs and confirm your installation. Here is an example using cilium as CNI plugin.

```console
# current terminal is at master node "200.x.x.1"
$ kubectl get po -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   cilium-6sjhd                       1/1     Running   0          13m
kube-system   cilium-gsb2g                       1/1     Running   0          13m
kube-system   cilium-operator-57bb669bf6-8nnxp   1/1     Running   0          13m
kube-system   cilium-operator-57bb669bf6-gjbkn   1/1     Running   0          13m
kube-system   coredns-59d6b54d97-gjc56           1/1     Running   0          8m22s
kube-system   coredns-59d6b54d97-ljnfs           1/1     Running   0          2m24s
kube-system   dns-autoscaler-78676459f6-ddkjh    1/1     Running   0          8m20s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-master1             1/1     Running   1          15m
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-master1    1/1     Running   1          14m
kube-system   kube-proxy-5mgc5                   1/1     Running   0          14m
kube-system   kube-proxy-tvjkb                   1/1     Running   0          14m
kube-system   kube-scheduler-master1             1/1     Running   1          14m
kube-system   nginx-proxy-node1                  1/1     Running   0          14m
kube-system   nodelocaldns-97kg7                 1/1     Running   0          8m19s
kube-system   nodelocaldns-fpfxj                 1/1     Running   0          8m19s
```

We can see that the cluster on VMs is installed successful.

## Delete the k8s cluster for VMs

If you no longer need cluster on VMs and want to delete the cluster, you only need to delete the cluster object.

### Find the cluster resource

Check the cluster object you have.

```console
$ kubectl get cluster
NAME                    PHASE      AGE    VERSION
cc-cluster   running    3h6m   
```

### Delete the customcluster resource

Delete the customcluster which you want.

```console
kubectl delete cluster cc-cluster 
```

The deleting action of cluster will get stuck due to the procedures of deletion of related object.

The deletion will create a terminating worker. The terminating worker will be responsible for cleaning up the cluster on the VMs.

You can open a new command tab in terminal to check the status of the terminate pod.

```console
$ kubectl get pod | grep terminate
cc-customcluster-terminate   1/1     Running   0          14s
```

After the terminate worker finished, the Cluster on VMs will be clean up and the related resource will also be deleted.

The entire deletion of cluster may take 5 min.
